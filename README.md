# Tic-Tac-Toe in Python

This project is a simple implementation of the tic-tac-toe (noughts and crosses) game in Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer in the console. The computer makes random moves, and its first move (placing an 'X' in the center of the board) is always predefined.

## Features

- Playable tic-tac-toe game in the console.
- The user plays with 'O' and the computer with 'X'.

2. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` script in your Python console.
